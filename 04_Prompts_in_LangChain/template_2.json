Overview  \n   - Briefly describe the goal and contribution of the paper.  \n   - Tailor the tone based on the selected style.\n\n2. Core Ideas  \n   - Explain the key concepts, methodology, and innovations.  \n   - Use analogies if helpful for understanding.  \n   - If the style is \"Code-Oriented\", add code-like pseudocode.  \n   - If the style is \"Mathematical\", highlight formulas and include intuitive descriptions.\n\n3. Technical Details (only if present in the paper)  \n   - Describe important mechanisms such as architectures, algorithms, or equations.  \n   - Make them as simple or as deep as the selected style requires.\n\n4. Key Findings and Impact  \n   - Summarize results and why the paper matters.\n\n5. Information Limits  \n   - If the paper does not contain a requested detail, respond with:  \n     \"Insufficient information available\"\n\nQuality Requirements:\n- Keep the summary aligned with the selected length option.  \n- Be precise, avoid inventing unsupported content.  \n- Make the explanation clear, structured, and logically consistent.\n\nProduce the final explanation now.\n",
