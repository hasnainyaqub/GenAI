      "The All Pakistan Muttahida Students Organization (APMSO; Urdu: (آل پاکستان متحدہ اسٹوڈنٹس آرگنائزیشن)) is a Pakistani student organization notable for creating a political party: the Muhajir Quami Movement, now called the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM).\n",
      "APMSO was founded by Altaf Hussain along with other students including Azeem Ahmed Tariq, Dr. Imran Farooq on Sunday, 11 June 1978 at Karachi University. It was one of the founding members of the United Student Movement.  Hussain also  served as a 1st Chairman of organization while Azeem Ahmed Tariq served as 1st General Secretary of the organization.\n",

      "== Creation and philosophy ==\n",
      "On 11 June 1978, Altaf Hussain and others created the All Pakistan Mohajir Students Organization (APMSO) to provide the university students a way to fight injustice. It became popular among students of Karachi University. APMSO won student union election in the 1980s.\n",
      "Many leaders rose from APMSO Azeem Ahmed Tariq, Imran Farooq, Farooq Sattar, Ishrat ul Ebad, Haider Abbas Rizvi and many others.\n",
      "According to APMSO's website, the philosophy of the APMSO and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement is Realism and Practicalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Mohajir identity ==\n",
      "Mohajirs had never liked the idea of identifying themselves with Sindhi population on the basis of ethnicity or nationality and were always hostile of \"Sindhi nationalism\" instead of \"ethnic nationalism\". But ethno-nationalist politicians convinced them that circumstances needed them to seek their identity on ethnic lines. The Muhajir sense of isolation came into being through a series of events. The three most important being the 1964 presidential elections, the 1972 language riots, and the post-1985 ethnic clashes between Muhajirs and non-Muhajirs in Karachi. \"During the December 1964 presidential elections, the Muhajir population of Karachi experienced a wrath of a Pathan backlash when Gohar Ayub Khan, son of President Ayub Khan, launched a series of attacks on Muhajir communities because of their support for Fatimah Jinnah, the sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, against Ayub Khan.\" Though Gohar Ayub's intentions were to target those who opposed his father, ethno-nationalists portrayed the move as specifically targeting Muhajirs At this time Ayub Khan moved the federal capital from Karachi to Islamabad, causing further anger amongst the elite of the Muhajir community, especially the bureaucracy.\n",
      "The 1972 language riots were caused by the passage of a language bill by the Sindhi Assembly declaring Sindhi to be the provincial language along with Urdu. The making of Sindhi as an equal language to Urdu for official purposes frustrated the elite of the Muhajir community as it disfavored their hegemony over the region.\n",
      "In June 1978 the All Pakistan Muhajir Student Organization was formed and it took on the task of creating a sense of distinction amongst Muhajir youth, on linguistic line, from the rest of Pakistanis. From the APMSO, in March 1984, was created the Muhajir Qaumi Movement. Now called the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), its leader declares its ideology to be based on Realism and Practicalism. The official MQM website states that \"Acceptance of reality with an open heart is Realism, a concept based upon the philosophy of its Founder and Leader Mr. Altaf Hussain. Based on Realism positive achievement made through ideologically supported pragmatic programs is called Practicalism.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Transition to MQM ==\n",
      "From the early days APMSO faced many attacks by the Thunder Squad of Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT). Jamiat feared losing its stronghold in the university to APMSO. Therefore, the Leadership of Islami Jamiat Talaba instructed its \"Thunder Squad\", led by Munawar Hasan, to remove APMSO and its leadership from university.\n",
      "In 1981 the Thunder Squad attacked stalls of APMSO at university gates with knives and revolver and badly wounded 16 members of APMSO, including founder of APMSO Altaf Hussain and then the squad entry of APMSO in university.\n",

      "Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. It is the fifth-most populous country, with a population of over 241.5 million, having the second-largest Muslim population as of 2023. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area. Bounded by the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir Creek on the southeast, it shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to the northeast. It shares a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the northwest by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor.\n",
      "Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan, the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age, and the ancient Gandhara civilisation. The regions that compose the modern state of Pakistan were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta; the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Samma, the Shah Miris, the Mughals, and finally, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.\n",
      "Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the partition of British India, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life. Initially a dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments that alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.\n",
      "Pakistan is considered a middle power nation, with the world's seventh-largest standing armed forces. It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies, with a large and rapidly growing middle class. Pakistan's political history since independence has been characterized by periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country continues to face poverty, illiteracy, corruption, and terrorism. Pakistan is a member of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States.\n",

      "== Etymology ==\n",
      "The name Pakistan was coined by Choudhry Rahmat Ali, a Pakistan Movement activist, who in January 1933 first published it (originally as \"Pakstan\") in a pamphlet Now or Never, using it as an acronym. Rahmat Ali explained: \"It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our homelands, Indian and Asian, Panjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan.\" He added, \"Pakistan is both a Persian and Urdu word... It means the land of the Paks, the spiritually pure and clean.\" Etymologists note that پاک pāk, is 'pure' in Persian and Pashto and the Persian suffix ـستان -stan means 'land' or 'place of'.\n",
      "Rahmat Ali's concept of Pakistan only related to the northwestern area of the Indian subcontinent. He also proposed the name \"Banglastan\" for the Muslim areas of Bengal and \"Osmanistan\" for Hyderabad State, as well as a political federation between the three.\n",
