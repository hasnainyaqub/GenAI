# Introduction to LangChain, LangChain for Beginners

## What is LangChain
LangChain is a framework that helps you build applications that use large language models in a structured and scalable way. It connects models with tools, memory, prompts, data sources, and multi step logic to produce reliable outputs.

## Why do we need LangChain
Using large language models directly becomes difficult when an application grows. LangChain solves challenges like managing long prompts, connecting models with external tools, handling multi step workflows, storing context, and switching between model providers.

## High Level Discussion of the App
This beginner project explains how to
- Build prompts and pass inputs to a model  
- Create simple chains that follow multi step logic  
- Use memory for chat style interaction  
- Call external tools or data sources  
- Run LLM powered workflows in a structured flow

## Benefits of LangChain
- Easy integration with many LLM providers  
- Tools for clean prompt management  
- Built in memory support  
- Chains for predictable workflow creation  
- Agents that call tools automatically  
- Faster prototyping for LLM apps

## What you can build with LangChain
- Chatbots  
- Text summarization tools  
- Document question answering apps  
- Search enhanced LLM tools  
- Multi step automation apps  
- Custom agents that use APIs or local tools  
- Data analysis tools powered by LLMs

## Alternatives to LangChain
- LlamaIndex  
- Haystack  
- Guidance  
- Semantic Kernel  
- OpenAI structured tools  

These alternatives provide similar features with different design styles.
